## Plugins

This will be a page about how to create/use plugins. (<abbr title="Work In Process">WIP</abbr>)

Before taking on the journey of building a custom plugin, please visit our official repository [awesome-summernote](https://github.com/summernote/awesome-summernote){:target="_blank"}. Which contains user contributed plugins. This may save you a lot of time building your own, or afford you the opportunity to contribute to an already existing plugin, making it better.
